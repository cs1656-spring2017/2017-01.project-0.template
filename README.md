### Description
This is the **test assignment** for the CS 1656 -- Introduction to Data Science (CS 2056) class, for the Spring 2017 semester.

### Goal
The goal of this assignment is to familiarize you with [github](https://github.com) and to also properly and authoritatively link your Pitt account with the github repositories that you will use to submit the assignments for the class.

### What to do
You are asked to visit the github classroom link that was provided to you. That will generate a private repository for you, with a template for the assignment, which includes a readme.md file and a registration.txt file. You will need to update file `registration.txt` to include the following:
* your first name
* your last name
* your Pitt email address (e.g., `labrinid@pitt.edu`)
* your Peoplesoft ID number (e.g., `3334444`) 
* the github account that you will use to submit *all* assignments from

### About your github account
It is very important that:  
* Your github account can do **private** repositories. If this is not already enabled, you can do it by visiting <https://education.github.com/>  
* You use the same github account for the duration of the course  
* You use the github account that you specified during the test assignment (i.e., this one)  

### How to submit your assignment
For the test assignment, you must use the repository that was created for you after visiting the classroom link. You need to update the `registration.txt` file, as specified above. Once you do that, you need to make sure to commit your changes to the repository. We will clone all repositories shortly after midnight on **Tuesday, January 24th, 2017 (i.e., at 12:15am, Wednesday, January 25, 2016)**. The **current** state of all repositories at that time is what we will use to grade this assignment.

### About the test assignment
Although this assignment carries no credit, it is **MANDATORY** in order to get **any** grade for subsequent assignments.
